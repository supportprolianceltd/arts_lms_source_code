                  <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>Modern slavery is an international crime affecting an estimated 40.3 million people worldwide. This global issue transcends age, gender, and ethnicity. It includes victims trafficked from overseas as well as vulnerable people in the UK who are illegally forced to work against their will in sectors such as agriculture, hospitality, construction, retail, and manufacturing.</p>
                  <p>Although A.R.T.S Training Services does not meet the £36 million turnover threshold required under the Modern Slavery Act 2015, we voluntarily adopt this statement to demonstrate our commitment to preventing modern slavery and human trafficking in our operations and supply chain.</p>
