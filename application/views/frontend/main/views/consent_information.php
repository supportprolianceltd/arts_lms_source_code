              <p>A.R.T.S Training Services processes personal data on behalf of employers and private individuals who enroll on our courses, using the lawful bases provided by GDPR, such as Legitimate Interests and Special Category Data (Article 9(2)(h)), for training purposes. In many cases, consent is not required for processing activities necessary for compliance with training standards and requirements.</p>
              <p>However, explicit consent will be obtained in specific situations, such as:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Sharing personal data with third-party professionals (e.g., evaluators or specialists).</li>
                  <li>Contacting external professionals for further information.</li>
                  <li>Providing recommendations beyond standard training assessments.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Our Role as a Service Provider</h3>
              <p>A.R.T.S Training Services provides professional training programs to employers and individuals to ensure participants meet required standards for their roles or personal development. Our services include:</p>

                  <li>Accredited and mandatory training courses.</li>
                  <li>Online training services, where personal data (including training progress and completion) is processed to confirm fulfilment of course requirements.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Methods for Obtaining Consent</h3>
              <p>A.R.T.S Training Services uses multiple methods to ensure that explicit consent is obtained from participants before any services are conducted. These methods are aligned with GDPR standards to ensure that all consent is fully informed, specific, and freely given. Methods for obtaining consent include, but are not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Written Consent:</strong> Obtained through completing enrolment forms and consent for escalation to third-party professionals if necessary.</li>
                  <li><strong>Online Consent:</strong> For online training, consent is obtained when participants access and engage with training materials. By completing the training, participants consent to processing their data for progress tracking and results sharing.</li>
                  <li><strong>Verbal Consent:</strong> In specific cases, verbal consent may be documented, particularly during consultations or follow-up evaluations.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>A.R.T.S Training Services may also implement additional methods to obtain consent based on the nature of the service or the requirements of clients and auditors.</p>
              <h3>Right to Withdraw Consent</h3>
              <p>Participants can withdraw their consent at any time, either verbally or in writing, without any negative consequences. Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of data processing before withdrawal. Upon withdrawal of consent, all further processing of personal data will cease unless legally required. Employers and participants will be promptly informed of any impacts on completing services, such as training programs.</p>
              <p>To withdraw consent, participants must contact A.R.T.S Training Services directly.</p>
